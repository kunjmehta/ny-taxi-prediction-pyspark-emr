# ny-taxi-prediction-pyspark-emr
<h5>A repository to contain the notebook for my big data project involving EDA and Machine Learning on the NY Taxi Fare dataset</h5>

***
### Motivation, Challenge & Accomplishment

* **Motivation:** Building and deploying a data science project with cloud technologies such as Apache Spark and AWS. After having enough theoretical knowledge of data science 
workflow and machine learning techniques and implementing few projects locally, I thought of going further and working out a workflow typically used in the industry for development
and deployment (that is cloud operations) and searched a big enough [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/new-york-city-taxi-fare-prediction) for it.

* **Challenge:** Get up and started with Spark and its Python wrapper, PySpark as well as managing clusters on AWS EMR, none of which I had done earlier. This also started my attempt
at completing one data science project each month starting with this for October.

* **Accomplishment:** Successfully performing EDA and feature engineering on the dataset and using the Spark MLlib to build RF and DT models and achieve an RMSE error around 4.
